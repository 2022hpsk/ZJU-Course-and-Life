Homework 1

Chapter 1: 13, 15, 16, 17, 18

Chapter 2: 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 22, 24, 27



#### Chapter 1

**13**: they can work out the same number of problems

prove:  although computer A has the subtract instruction, but when A need use subtract instruction and num1. num2 , B can use add instruction and num1, the negative of num2. And the solution of the answer is same.



**15**:  advantage: less time to program

​		disadvantage: more run time  



**16**:       **ISA** includes as follows:

- the operations the computer can perform
- the acceptable representations for operands, which called data type.
-  figure out where the operands are located, which called addressing mode



**17:** we can briefly tell difference between ISA and Micro architecture like this:

we can regard ISA like interface, it fix the rules between software and hardware, and use these interfaces we can transform program to its ISA, and Micro architecture determines the achieve of the ISA, maybe we can use 100 logic circuits to achieve, but we also can use 50 replaced to save the cost, it all depends on the developers.



**18**:  a Micro architecture can only implement only one ISA.

​		But a ISA can be implemented by many Micro architecture





#### Chapter 2

8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 22, 24, 27

**8**: the largest positive number in 8-bit complement code is **127(decimal), 01111111(binary)**

  the largest negative number in 8-bit complement code is **-128(decimal),10000000(binary)**

​	the largest positive number in n-bit code is $ 2^{n-1}-1$ 

​	the largest  negative number in n-bit is $-2^{n-1}$

**10:**

- -6
- 90
- -2
- 14803

**11:**

- 01100110
- 01000000
- 00100001
- 10000000
- 01111111

**13**:

- 11111010
- 00011001
- 11111000
- 00000001

**17**:

- 1100 -4
- 01010100  84
- 0011 3
- 11 -1

**22**:

- 0111111111111111+0111111111111111
- 1000000000000000+100000000000000

**24**:

- 1111111111111111+1111111111111111
- 1111111111111111+0000000000000001

**27**: the answer has the problem: because the calculate number are positive number ,but the answer is a negative number.
