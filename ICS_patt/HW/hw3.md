#### Chapter 3: 27, 29, 31, 33, 41, 43, 44



**27**：

the output of the logic circuit depends on A, if input of A is 1,then Z is 1, else Z is 0

it also depends on A, if A is 0, the result don't change(still 0),but if A is 1,the result will still 1

It's storage element, if S choose A ,it change the storage, else it keep the same.



**29**:

No .The value is removed after the new value is written 



**31**:

the memory size is $2^3*8=64 bytes$



**33**:

a: to read the fourth memory location, A[1:0] must be 11 and WE is 0

b: totally we only 6 address lines for a memory with 60, and the addressability of the memory is unchanged.

c: if we don't change the width of the counter, only $2^6-60=4$ locations can be added.
